### 📦 Ecosystem
Dream is modular. You use what you need:

**Core:**
- `dream` - Router, HTTP types, response builders, validation

**Data:**
- `dream_postgres` - PostgreSQL utilities, query helpers
- `dream_opensearch` - OpenSearch client for search

**Utilities:**
- `dream_http_client` - HTTP client with streaming support
- `dream_config` - Configuration management (env vars, .env files)
- `dream_json` - JSON encoding utilities
- `dream_ets` - ETS (Erlang Term Storage) for in-memory storage

See the [Architecture Reference](reference/architecture.md#modules-ecosystem) for detailed module documentation and usage examples.
