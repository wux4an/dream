# Contributing to Dream

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Dream is a community project and we welcome contributions.

## Philosophy

Before contributing, understand Dream's core philosophy:

- **Library, not framework** - Provide building blocks, not opinions
- **Explicit over implicit** - No magic, no hidden behavior
- **Simple over clever** - Code should be obvious
- **Type-safe** - Leverage Gleam's type system fully
- **No closures** - All dependencies explicit

Read [Design Principles](docs/reference/design-principles.md) for the full picture.

## Code Style

Follow the [Naming Conventions](docs/reference/naming-conventions.md):

- Functions: `{verb}_{noun}` pattern
- No module name prefixes
- Full words, no abbreviations (except standard ones like `id`, `http`, `json`)
- Builder pattern for configuration

Use `gleam format` before committing:

```bash
gleam format
```

## Testing

All code must have tests. Dream requires **100% test coverage** of `src/dream/`.

### Unit Tests

- Black box testing only (test public interfaces)
- No external dependencies (no database, network, files)
- Fast (milliseconds)
- Deterministic (same result every time)

See [Testing Guide](docs/guides/testing.md) for details.

### Running Tests

```bash
gleam test
```

### Test Naming

```gleam
pub fn function_name_with_condition_returns_expected_result_test()
```

Example:

```gleam
pub fn create_user_with_valid_data_returns_user_test()
pub fn create_user_with_empty_name_returns_error_test()
```

## Documentation

All public functions must have documentation comments:

```gleam
/// Creates a new router with no routes configured.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```gleam
/// import dream/core/router.{router}
///
/// let my_router = router
/// ```
pub fn router() -> Router(context, services) {
  Router(routes: [])
}
```

Include:
- Brief description of what the function does
- Example usage with imports
- Any important notes or caveats

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write code
   - Write tests
   - Write documentation
   - Run `gleam format`

4. **Verify everything works**
   ```bash
   gleam check    # Type checking
   gleam test     # All tests pass
   gleam format   # Code formatted
   ```

5. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add middleware chaining support"
   ```

   Use conventional commits:
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `docs:` - Documentation only
   - `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - `test:` - Adding or updating tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

6. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Wait for review**
   - Address feedback
   - Keep PR scope focused
   - Be patient and respectful

## What to Contribute

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`. These are specifically chosen for newcomers.

### Bug Reports

Found a bug? Open an issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Minimal code to reproduce
- Your environment (Gleam version, OS)

### Feature Requests

Have an idea? Open an issue describing:
- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Why it fits Dream's philosophy
- Example API/usage

We may say no if it doesn't align with Dream's goals. That's okay.

### Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:
- Fix typos
- Clarify confusing sections
- Add examples
- Improve organization

## Publishing (Maintainers Only)

Dream is published to Hex.pm. Only maintainers can publish.

### Publishing Process

1. **Update version in `gleam.toml`**
   ```toml
   version = "1.0.1"
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   Document all changes since last release.

3. **Create release commit and tag**
   ```bash
   git add gleam.toml CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.1"
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

4. **Publish to Hex**
   ```bash
   gleam publish
   ```

5. **Publish documentation**
   ```bash
   gleam docs publish
   ```

### Semantic Versioning

Dream follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) - Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) - New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) - Bug fixes (backward compatible)

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Be professional. Be kind.

We're all here to build something useful. Treat others how you'd want to be treated.

- ✅ Constructive criticism
- ✅ Helping newcomers
- ✅ Assuming good intent

- ❌ Personal attacks

Violations will result in removal from the project.

## Questions?
